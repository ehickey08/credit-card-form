# credit-card-form

This repo is an attempt to create a credit card form based on a medium post suggesting [6 frontend challenges](https://medium.com/better-programming/here-are-6-frontend-challenges-to-code-9952190c97cc).

The form is built with React and styled-components. It includes number formatting, validation, and automatic card-type detection.
