# credit-card-form

This repo is an attempt to create a credit card form based on a medium post suggesting [6 frontend challenges](https://medium.com/better-programming/here-are-6-frontend-challenges-to-code-9952190c97cc).

The form is built with React and styled-components. It includes number formatting, validation, and automatic card-type detection. 

Inspiration and css styling was drawn from the original repo linked in the medium post, which can also be found [here](https://github.com/muhammederdem/credit-card-form).
